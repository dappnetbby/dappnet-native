DAPPNET NATIVE

* 5MB macOS binary, containing IPFS, Ethereum node, and web browser
* native ObjC + Cocoa UI. 
* alt-tab through uniswap, 1inch, etc.
* extremely low footprint


The end extension of this is to build a native macOS Ethereum wallet. 

You can install dapps by opening dappnet://uniswap.eth, clicking download, which downloads the web app as a .zip from IPFS to your computer.

Then the web app is yours to keep, it instantly loads. Suddenly - we have an app distribution method that is like an app store, but decentralized.

Uniswap, Curve, etc. will show a native application icon in the dock.
